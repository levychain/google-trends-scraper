# War Vertical Competitive Report (SEO + Editorial)

Date: 2026-02-18 (PST)  
Goal: Build an in-depth U.S.-Iran-Israel / WW3-risk podcast that can win search and platform ranking through depth + cadence.

## Strategic Note To Save (from your Epstein insight)
The growth play is not just choosing a hot keyword. It is:
1. pick a high-intent keyword cluster,
2. publish at a cadence competitors do not match,
3. create connected, cumulative episodes with sources,
4. become the default catalog result for that cluster on Spotify/Apple/YouTube.

This is exactly what happened in the Epstein lane and is the right playbook to replicate.

## Competitor Benchmarks (RSS-derived)
Method: episode counts and cadence are derived from public RSS feeds (as observed in feed windows; some hosts cap feed history).

| Podcast | Episodes in feed | First pub in feed | Latest pub | Episodes last 90d | Episodes last 30d | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| War on the Rocks | 326 | 2013-07-08 | 2026-02-06 | 8 | 3 | Defense strategy depth; insider audience |
| Net Assessment (WOTR) | 100 | 2021-10-29 | 2026-02-12 | 7 | 2 | Military posture/strategy interview style |
| The Lawfare Podcast | 2848 | 2012-01-30 | 2026-02-18 | 103 | 34 | Massive volume; legal-policy lens |
| Pod Save the World | 515 | 2017-01-27 | 2026-02-18 | 12 | 5 | Accessible geopolitics; opinion-forward |
| The Red Line | 142 | 2019-10-07 | 2026-02-10 | 1 | 1 | Strong deep dives, low cadence |
| Call Me Back (Dan Senor) | 461 | 2020-11-12 | 2026-02-19 | 38 | 13 | High cadence, Israel-centric network |
| Times of Israel Daily Briefing | 100 | 2025-11-19 | 2026-02-18 | 98 | 35 | Daily news cadence; brief format |
| Global News Podcast (BBC) | 251 | 2019-10-25 | 2026-02-19 | 165 | 61 | Very high-frequency global updates |
| President's Daily Brief | 1572 | 2022-04-05 | 2026-02-18 | 137 | 48 | Daily intelligence-style briefings |
| The Iran Podcast | 157 | 2020-05-26 | 2026-02-16 | 20 | 10 | Iran-specific and timely |
| Battle Lines (Telegraph) | 246 | 2023-10-20 | 2026-02-18 | 39 | 13 | Geopolitical conflict framing |
| The World Next Week (CFR) | 100 | 2023-03-09 | 2025-02-27 | 0 | 0 | Forecast format; currently inactive in feed |

## What They Cover (and what they miss)
Current coverage patterns:
- Fast news briefs: BBC, TOI, PDB
- Expert interviews: WOTR, Net Assessment, Red Line
- Policy/legal framing: Lawfare
- Opinion + political framing: Pod Save the World, Call Me Back

Open lane (your opportunity):
- A connected investigative war-risk narrative with explicit escalation maps.
- U.S.-household consequences (prices, markets, cyber, draft fear, travel, domestic security) tied to battlefield events.
- Source-heavy, episode-to-episode continuity (not one-off commentary).

## Saturation vs Opportunity
Saturated:
- Generic daily headlines.
- "What happened today" recap formats.

Underserved:
- "If X happens, what happens in the next 72 hours" scenario analysis.
- Unified U.S.-Iran-Israel decision-room model.
- War-risk series with both depth and publishing velocity.

## SEO + Editorial Balance Framework
Use a dual-title system:
- Public title (SEO-first): exact query phrase first.
- Internal arc title (editorial): series continuity label.

Example:
- Public: "Will the U.S. Go to War With Iran? 3 Real Scenarios"
- Arc label: "Escalation Ladder E07"

Title template:
1. Primary query term (front-loaded)
2. Outcome promise
3. Time/context marker when needed (e.g., "This Week", "2026")

## Keyword Clusters To Own
Primary cluster:
- world war 3
- us iran war
- israel iran war
- war with iran
- us israel iran conflict

Secondary cluster:
- strait of hormuz closure
- iran nuclear timeline
- hezbollah war israel
- us draft world war 3
- gas prices war middle east

Tertiary cluster (distribution expansion):
- cyberattack iran
- oil shock war
- red sea shipping crisis
- proxy war middle east

## Cadence Moat Recommendation
To beat incumbents on both depth and search freshness:
1. Weekly flagship deep dive: 2 episodes/week (45-60 min)
2. Breaking escalation brief: 3-5 short episodes/week (8-15 min)
3. Monthly scenario pack: 1 long simulation episode/month

Target: 12-18 episodes/month sustained for 6+ months.

## Programming Architecture (50-episode viability)
Structure every episode with repeatable segments:
1. What changed in 24-72 hours
2. Escalation ladder position
3. U.S. options matrix
4. Iran and Israel likely responses
5. Civilian/economic effects
6. Sources and confidence levels

This creates bingeable continuity and improves platform session depth.

## KPIs That Matter
- Episode velocity (per 30 days)
- Search-entry episodes (% from keyword discovery)
- Catalog completion rate (listeners moving to older episodes)
- Returning listener ratio (7-day and 30-day)
- Share/save rate on short escalation briefs

## Platform Ranking Playbook
1. Launch 10-episode starter cluster in 2-3 weeks.
2. Flood primary keywords with tightly-linked episodes.
3. Use consistent naming syntax so episodes interlink in search and recommendations.
4. Build "Start Here" + "Escalation Timeline" playlists.
5. Refresh top-performing keywords weekly from Trends.

## Risk Controls
- Keep sourcing standards explicit (on-record, docs, satellite/open-source where possible).
- Separate analysis from advocacy language.
- Track a corrections log; credibility is the moat for this vertical.
